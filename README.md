<h1 >Art Gallery Project:framed_picture:</h1>

This project is from my database design course

<h1 >Target:art:</h1>

The target is to crawl data from an online [art gallery](https://www.ss.net.tw/), including author, time, location and picture size. The website is built by firebase and React.js, I also use MUI to decorate the website, making it more interactive.
