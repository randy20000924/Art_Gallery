<h1 >Art Gallery Project:framed_picture:</h1>

This project is from my database design course

<h1 >Target:art:</h1>

The target is to crawl data from an online [art gallery](https://www.ss.net.tw/), including author, time, location, and picture size. The website is built by firebase and React.js, I also use MUI to decorate the website, making it more interactive. 

<h1 >What I learned:rocket:</h1>

In this project, I learned how to use SQL to control firebase API, and using python to turn all the data to JSON form. This project is a team project, since I was a leader, I also learned how to allocate different task to my teammates, tapping their potentials, and  maximize the productivity.
